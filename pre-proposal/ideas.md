## Final Ideas Listing:



#### Anonymised IM P2P Client-side Application

Utilise peer-to-peer encrypted traffic and encryption to provide ASCII-based instant messaging, using GPG public keys. Utilising Peer to peer connections, we could minimise the necessity of external servers



#### Native imageboard application

Create a naganaki/iOS integrated native application for iOS rather than a web application/running naganaki in a web browser, e.g. fetching data from naganaki servers, parse data into application to be natively displayed.



#### Networking/Serverside Cable Management

For networking techs, managing patches/optical connections. Lists currently connected machines via user input.



#### JSON-Based data visualisation/indexing

Google Maps API with customisable JSON/KML dataset input to produce graphical representations/using graphs & other means of plotting data in graphing tools



#### Physical music item listings for purchase (use Apple Pay/similar)

Use Discogs/Amazon/other online shopping applications to compile data and list by artists/LPs/EPs. Enables easy cross-site listing of physical music. Include shipping options (e.g. display if CD will not ship to Australia, but another listing will ship to Australia). Include best-price listing.



#### IST Cheatsheet

Multi view application that opens on  a 2x\* table of different programming languages' icons and names, that when clicked take you to a cheat sheet of said language. *Not limited to programming languages, eg: html, css, md and such*



#### MIDI/Audio Cable Management

For audio techs, managing patches/leads/MIDI IO and all audio devices. Also provides details to audio rigging and currently connected devices via user input.



#### Vehicle Information Indexing App

This app could parse some manually created JSON in order catalog certain vehicles of a type (like cars or submarines). Each vehicle would have its own object, whose properties would contain information about the vehicle. eg: max speed and sonar range for submarines, or weight and engine capacity for cars. The data would be parsed programmatically onto a view about said vehicle
