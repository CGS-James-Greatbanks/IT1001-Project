## Final Ideas Listing:

### Anonymised IM P2P Client-side Application

Utilise peer-to-peer encrypted traffic and encryption to provide ASCII-based instant messaging, using GPG public keys. Utilising Peer to peer connections, we could minimise the necessity of external servers. We could also utilise iMessage style group chats, to maximise the usefulness of the app. We feel this is a good idea because as it stands there are no peer to peer, encrypted, instant messaging services. This could render the idea incredibly useful for a wide array of demographics, from government workers working with sensitive material, to the everyday person who just wants to maintain their privacy. We would really enjoy this idea due to the heavy reliance on local to external networking and the massive amount of encryption based code we would be writing, as we both enjoy the intricacies of encryption and networking.

### Native imageboard application

Create an imageboard integrated native application for iOS rather than a web application running the imageboard in a web browser, e.g. fetching data from said imageboard's servers, parsing data into application to be natively displayed. This could be useful because it could centralise many imageboards into one iOS application. This could prove to be a very difficult project however due to the differences between how certain imageboard's data is stored and displayed. We like this idea, and would be motivated because we both have a passion for imageboards.

### Networking/Server-side Cable Management

For networking techs, managing patches/optical connections. Lists currently connected machines via user input, and could catalog cables being used along with their respective IO connections. Both of us think this is a very useful idea, based on past experience. I (James) having 2 switches amongst a small network of machines, have had problems maintaining a consistent and easy to understand organisation system, and keeping track of which ports are hooked into which machine.

### JSON-Based data visualisation/indexing

Google Maps API with customisable JSON/KML dataset input to produce graphical representations/using graphs & other means of plotting data in graphing tools. We are less enthusiastic about this idea as it's not unique and there's likely a better version somewhere else on the app store. However depending on the data we use (and if we avoid .kml files) this could be a fairly feasible idea.

### Physical music item listings for purchase (use Apple Pay/similar)

Use Discogs/Amazon/other online shopping applications and user submitted data from physical stores in order to compile data and list by artists/LPs/EPs. Enables easy cross-site and physical location listing of physical music. Include shipping options (e.g. display if CD will not ship to Australia, but another listing will ship to Australia). Include best-price listing. We're both pretty big music enthusiasts, and we both tend to prefer having a physical version of an LP, be it on CD or vinyl. It's an absolute pain to actually search for physical music in the evergrowing digital music/streaming era. I, personally spend well over a month trying to find a rare Led Zeppelin dvd when in fact a small music shop in Weston had the dvd the whole time, and as I understand James is currently in a similar situation with a Radiohead dvd. Having an app like this could collate real world items from many different stores into one centralised, publicly accessible database, built by the public themselves.

### IST Cheatsheet

Multi view application that opens on a 2x* table of different programming languages' icons and names, that when clicked take you to a cheat sheet of said language. _Not limited to programming languages, eg: HTML, CSS, Markdown and such_ This could be useful for any and all students studying software, who need a quick and easy to access cheat sheet for their respective programming language. We would really enjoy making this because it could be useful for James and I. The only concern we have is that there are likely many other cheatsheets already on the app store.

### MIDI/Audio Cable Management

For audio techs, managing patches/leads/MIDI I/O and all audio devices. Also provides details to audio rigging and currently connected devices via user input. I (James), being pretty savy with audio tech/synths find it to be incredibly irritating wondering why you're getting a monophonic sound out of a 64 polyphonous synth, only to realise 20 mins later you've only got 1 MIDI lead plugged into your sound card. Irritating little nuances like this could be completely alleviated by being able to give distinct descriptions to each audio device and listing their comprehensive I/O setups. A list of all connected devices with proper connection information would allow for much deeper clarity and ease of access in rigging/maintaining any (even basic) audio setup.

### Vehicle Information Indexing App

This app could parse some manually created JSON in order catalog certain vehicles of a type (like cars or submarines). Each vehicle would have its own object, whose properties would contain information about the vehicle. eg: max speed and sonar range for submarines, or weight and engine capacity for cars. The data would be parsed programmatically onto a view about said vehicle. We are both really enthused about this idea as respectively James and I are really interested in cars and submarines, so there is no question we'd do the idea justice. There are however target market and feasibility issues with this idea. For cars the target market is huge, however the sheer amount of data would make it very difficult. The target market for submarines is considerably smaller however the amount of data is much more manageable.
