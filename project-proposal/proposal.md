### Problem Analysis

Don't lie. Cable management is a pain. It always has been. You always tell yourself when you're configuring your setup, that this time, this time, you'll organize the cables. And yet they always seem to end up in one big tangled cluster behind the setup. This makes moving and/or changing any part of the setup incredibly difficult as it becomes difficult to determine which cable is which, and what their respective I/O is. There exist physical attempts to solve the problem, such as labeling your cables and using identifiers. These miss the root cause of the problem though. You need a way to track and log all of your cables. All the inputs and outputs, and any other identifying characteristics, such as color and type of cable. This is an issue to anyone who has their own setup, and even more so a major issue to those who have to manage setups, such as system administrators.

### Existing Solutions

<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) **Sidewinder** - Cable Installation Management

Sidewinder is an application for iOS devices running iOS 10 and up. The application appears to be very similar to our initial concept, being based on a set of table views and it is based around assisting with cable management.

From the screenshots available, the application appears to have a lot of parameters available for each cable, along with a way to sync setups with other network administrators/cabling staff.

However, when we attempted to open this application on our phones, Sidewinder requested credentials. There is no visible way to make an account or request an account on the login screen, and we were barred from the application.

<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) **Connect Master™**

Connect Master™ appears to be an application for managing very large and significant cabling networks/setups that will usually contain underground cabling and cover multiple datacenters.

This application appears to be on a much more broad scale than we intend to put PatchMan on. Even though we intend to use Core Data, setup managers/cable staff of this magnitude of setup are not our target audience.

It is difficult to gauge how we could incorporate features of this application into ours, because there is no distinct way to get a trial or demo of the application. All applications for a demo or trial are via email, and there is no trial/downloadable version that is readily available.
