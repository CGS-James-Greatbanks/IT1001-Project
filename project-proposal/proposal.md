### Problem Analysis

Don't lie. Cable management is a pain. It always has been. You always tell yourself when you're configuring your setup, that this time, this time, you'll organise the cables. And yet they always seem to end up in one big tangled cluster behind the setup. This makes moving and/or changing any part of the setup incredibly difficult as it becomes difficult to determine which cable is which, and what their respective I/O is. There exist physical attempts to solve the problem, such as labeling your cables and using identifiers. These miss the root cause of the problem though. You need a way to track and log all of your cables. All the inputs and outputs, and any other identifying characterisics, such as colour and type of cable.
